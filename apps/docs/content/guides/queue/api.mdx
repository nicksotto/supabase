title: Supabase Queues API
---

When you create a queue in Supabase, it creates both a private and public pgmq schema. The pgmq_public schema exposes common queue maintenance operations to clients, but does not expose functions for creating or dropping queues. Exposed functions are automatically available via PostgREST, and can be called with the supabase.rpc method.

See the [Quickstart](/docs/guides/queue/quickstart) for an example.

The full list of available Queue functions is:
