You can alter your Cron Jobs from the [Cron Jobs](/dashboard/project/_/integrations/cron-jobs) tab in the Integrations section of the dashboard.

## Edit a Cron Job

1. Locate your Cron Job in the [Cron Jobs](/dashboard/project/_integrations/cron-jobs) view.
1. Expand the options menu and select `Edit cron job`.
1. Review and edit the Cron Job settings, then click `Save job`.

## Disable a Cron Job

You can disable a Cron Job without deleting it. This is useful if you might want to use it again in the future.

1. Locate your Cron Job in the [Cron Jobs](/dashboard/project/_integrations/cron-jobs) view.
2. Toggle the `Active` toggle.

## Delete a Cron Job

Permanently delete a Cron Job to remove it entirely:

1. Locate your Cron Job in the [Cron Jobs](/dashboard/project/_integrations/cron-jobs) view.
1. Expand the options menu and select `Delete job`.
1. Review and edit the Cron Job settings, then click `Save job`.

## Manage your Cron Jobs using SQL

You can also use SQL to manage your Cron Jobs. For example, to edit a job:

```sql
cron.alter_job(
  job_id bigint,
  schedule text default null,
  command text default null,
  database text default null,
  username text default null,
  active boolean default null
)
```

To unschedule a job:

```sql
select cron.unschedule('job-name');
```
